In recent years, driven by the requirements for interoperability and agility, the transformation from traditional rigid manufacture to flexible and dynamic networks is accelerating. To follow this trend, the fourth industry revolution or Industrie 4.0 (I4.0) emerges, aiming to bring intelligent networking of devices and processes for legacy industrial automation.   

"RAMI 4.0 combines the crucial elements of Industrie 4.0 in a three-dimensional layer model". "It provides a common understanding of Industrie 4.0 technologies" As the corner stone of interoperability, the Asset Administration Shell is proposed to represent the digital part in Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS). 

基于以上这些原因，本文将管理壳模型和61499模型相结合。

"IEC 61499 defines a general model and methodology for describing function blocks in a format that is independent of implementation. The methodology can be used by system designers to construct distributed control systems. It allows a system to be defined in terms of logically connected function blocks that run on different processing resources."

61499与61131-3的区别："event-based execution semantics"
